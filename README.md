# SocketChat

A simple app to chat with anyone you want on the same network.

SocketChat is a messaging app that helps you communicate with your friends on the same network. Just make a session and enjoy talking to your friends.

The app does not use any third party database to store your chat, its all saved in a local database and you can delete any session whenever you want.

You can customize the app however you want:

    * change your username
    
    * change app theme
    
    * change chat bubble appearance

This app is all you need when it comes to local network text chatting.
