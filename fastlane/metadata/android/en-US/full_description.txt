<i>SocketChat</i> is a messaging app that helps you communicate with your friends on the same network, where one of the devices with this app installed acts as server. Just make a session and enjoy talking to your friends.
The app does not use any third party database to store your chat, its all saved in a local database and you can delete any session whenever you want.
You can customize the app however you want:
    * change chat bubble appearance
    * connection history
    * continue chatting in any network
    * server authentication

This app is all you need when it comes to local network text chatting.
